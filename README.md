# Nike Shoes Frontend Website

This project is a responsive frontend website inspired by Nike’s shoe collection, built using pure HTML and CSS. The website focuses on delivering a clean, modern, and interactive user interface without using any JavaScript or external frameworks.  
It showcases multiple shoe products, each with a visually appealing layout and a review-style presentation, making it suitable for practicing real-world e-commerce UI design.
